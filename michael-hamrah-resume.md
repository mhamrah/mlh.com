## Profile

I am a software engineer passionate about technology and solving problems with elegant solutions.  I have proven success building scalable, distributed systems for the web leveraging agile principles.  My focus is on data modeling and storage, API design, and concurrent, asynchronous programming.

## Expertise

I am proficient with several programming languanges, specifically Ruby and Javascript, with a long history of C# and a short history of C++.  I apply a test-driven approach to development incorporating design and architectural patterns to build highly maintainable systems.  My experience includes object-orientated and functional programming along with exploitation of VMs, runtimes and frameworks.  I am currently exploring several aspects of Scala and Akka along with the Go (golang) programming language.

I have extensive knowledge of web based systems across all levels of the software stack.  This includes Html, Css, and Javascript development and optimization; HTTP fundamentals; web servers (IIS, Apache, Nginx); caching techniques and tools (Memcache, Varnish, CDNs); various web frameworks and application servers (Rails, Sinatra, EM, Node/Express, ASP.NET MVC); RESTful and other web based services; networking protocols and data compression; queue based systems; search servers (Solr, ElasticSearch); cloud tools (Heroku, AWS, CloudFoundry) and both SQL (PostgreSql, SQL Server) and NoSql (Redis, Cassandra, MongoDb) databases.  My career has been focused on leveraging these tools to build optimized, fault tolerant systems that work under load at a global scale. 

I have led teams of various sizes using Scrum and Kanban techniques, actively engaging with stakeholders to empower business.  I have worked with key personnel to brainstorm, define, prioritize and measure features.  My work has been to foster top talent, mentor junior developers, and recruit new hires.  I constantly seek to bridge the gap between business and technology.

## Work Experience

+--{: #freelance .work}
### Freelance Software Engineer
####{: .dates} April 2012 - August 2012

I assisted PolicyMic, a media startup, to scale their php based website on AWS to meet performance requirements for an actively growing user base and the US election.  This involved a rollout, analysis, and education of New Relic; various database tuning and index work; implementation of a new caching tier via AWS ElastiCache; client-side optimization; network analysis; data modeling, Varnish implementation and page rendering optimizations. I developed a strong partnership with the business to understand the problem domain and create viable solutions to solve short and long term problems, teaching best practices and ways to think at scale.

I assisted the General Assembly, a NYC based resource for software startups and developers, to mentor a team of developers for a pilot program to help recent student graduates gain real world programming experience.  The primary focus was on collaboration in an agile environment and I had a hands on role in teaching students to work through development challenges, leverage SCM tools (Git/Github), implement TDD and understand Scrum (story writing and sizing, sprints, standups, retrospectives).

I assisted VFILES, an early stage startup in social fashion media, to lead their technology team.  I built up an in-house development team and worked with a consulting agency to bootstrap the website for initial launch.  I architected and developed a variety of features leveraging Ruby on Rails on the backend with an Html5/Jquery based front end. The site ran on Heroku and leveraged several AWS components and other cloud based services. Source control managed with git via Github.  The site featured extensive use of caching infrastructure and background queue-based processing. The search was powered by ElasticSearch and featured field boosting with various text analyzers. Other backend servers include PostgreSql and Redis.  I applied lean startup principles to the organization and brought the site to private beta before planned departure. I assisted with product development and prioritization.

### Director, Software Engineering *Getty Images*
####{: .dates} 2007 - April 2012

I reported to the VP of Technology and lead a twelve person team architecting and developing solutions for the Getty Images Sports, News and Entertainment division. I was responsible for driving technology for Getty’s fastest growing segment, with tools used globally by photographers, editors, sales, external partners and executives to manage all editorial content. I was a leader in the technology organization across geographic offices to drive Getty’s success in digital media.

Architected a web-based workflow portal using ASP.NET MVC (started with beta, now on MVC3) using SOA principles allowing users to easily manage various enterprise systems in a unified, cohesive setting. Project replaced numerous, disconnected third party tools in order to unify Editorial technology and streamline workflow for a wide range of users. Architecture features asynchronous communication for long-running tasks, a multi-tier architecture, MVC Areas for codebase management and various jQuery and Knockout.js goodies for a smooth user experience where time-to-market is essential.

Application architecture includes various n-tier applications developed using Domain Driven Design paradigms, glued together with IoC containers and backed with various unit tests. Service-Orientated applications feature WCF-based web services written with .NET 4.0 for cross-platform integration (ruby and java). Systems feature Sql Server including Service Broker for queue based processing, with open-source tools and frameworks. Search powered by Solr with MongoDb usage for specific functionality suited for nosql solutions. Hands on development with team in all areas of the system, from writing stored procedures to css and from initial design to production debugging.

Engineered a highly scalable automated asset distribution system delivering 2+ million images per day via ftp or http supporting bursts of 200,000+ images/hour. System features dynamic code generation to support extremely fast calculation to route images based on any number of rules within seconds of receipt. Also supports metadata management, image processing, extensive tracking and is designed for elastic scalability.

Work closely with various business units, including VPs, Executives, Architects, Project Managers and other Development teams to come up with both business workflow and technical solutions for Getty Images. Drive agile principles in an ever improving process to operate more efficiently.
